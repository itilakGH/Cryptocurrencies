# Unsupervised ML with Cryptocurrencies
### In this project we used unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market
### The goals for this project are:
- To prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
- To reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
- To predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
- To create some plots and data tables to present your results.
### The tools and technologies used in the project:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- csv file with data
- GitHub
